# TribeHub

## Project goals

This project provides a Django Rest Framework backend for the TribeHub React web app. It has also been designed with a future native iOS app in mind.

TribeHub is designed to be a virtual equivalent to the typical wall planner a family might put up in a kitchen or other communal area. The primary goals of the web app are to:
1) Provide busy families with a single, central hub around which to plan and organise busy lives and schedules. This should include calendar/event scheduling functionality similar to a family wall planner, enabling events to be scheduled for one or multiple family members, and viewed by all the family.
2) Deliver a simple and intuitive user experience, suitable for adults and tech literate children aged 10+. 
3) Offer a minimal set of impactful features chosen in order to deliver a useful app within an achievable development timeframe, while laying a solid foundation for additional features in the future.

### Resolved bugs

- During testing, it became apparent that a user could not create a calendar event with no other members of the tribe invited (i.e. events only for themselves), because the `to` field on the `Event` model defaulted to not allowing null values. This was fixed by adding `null=True` and `blank=True` arguments to the model.
- Testing also revealed that the programatically generated events returned as repeat occurences included the currently authenticated user rather than the user who created the event as the owner. This was fixed by changing two variables in `events/utils.py`.
- Testing demonstrated that sending using an id for a non-existent event object for the `events/response/<id>` endpoint resulted in an uncaught exception. Try...except blocks were added to  the EventResponse class in `events/views.py` to ensure any references to non-existent events are handled gracefully alongside permission related errors, and that appropriate HTTP status codes are returned for each class of error.

### Unresolved bugs

- The `perform_create` method of the `ListCreate` generic view is overriden in `contacts/views.py`. Django did not seem to respond correctly to custom permission classes when this method is overriden, meaning that unauthorised users (i.e. authenticated users without tribe admin status) were able create new contacts. It was verified that the relevant custom permission classes were being called and returning the correct values, and it remains uncertain whether this issue is due to a bug in Django Rest Framework or in this project. The issue was overcome by manually checking the status of the user, but given more time it would be good to look into this further and revert to correct use of permission classes if possible.
